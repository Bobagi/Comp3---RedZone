# Red Zone
This game was developed for university classes to illustrate the concepts of semaphores and threads in operating systems.

It's a remake of the game that was made in 2019. The game is quite challenging, requiring focus, attention, and a good memory of all the elements involved in the process.

You can play it in your browser: https://bobagi.itch.io/red-zone
Alternatively, you can download the zipped file with the compilation for Windows.
